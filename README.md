Utilities for AV ([Anonymous for the
Voiceless](https://www.anonymousforthevoiceless.org)) projects.

Here you can find the R code I use to manage the process/team involved
in Italian subtitles creation for [YouTube
videos](https:/youtube.com/anonymousforthevoiceless) (in case it could
be useful for someone else). Our first subbed video was [this
one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ9kGZMbyVw).

Here is the background machinery, the repository with the subs
themselves is [here](https://github.com/lbraglia/av_it_subs).
